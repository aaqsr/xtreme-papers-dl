# xtremepaper downloader

**NOTE: AS OF NOW, ON WINDOWS THE FOLDER PATH WILL NOT WORK, PLEASE EDIT THE `folder_path` VARIABLE IN XTREME.py**

## CHANGELOG

Old repo hadn't been updated for a few years. As such it was not working. 
So I thought I'd fork it and fix it.
As of now on my mac the download for papers works for O LEVEL papers. 
Just be sure to add your own urls. (The get code system has not been tested but is left in for now until it can be verified to be working.)

The first important priority for me was getting the core parts of this up and running.
I don't have time as of now, but the second I do, I'll probably make many more changes and fixes.

Original repo by CubeOvO. Mirrored with permission :)
