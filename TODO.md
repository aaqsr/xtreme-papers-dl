## MISC
* Fix grammatical mistakes
* Write better docs

## TESTING
* Test if requirements.txt works

* Test the get code system
* Test the entire program with unexpected values
* Test on windows system
* Test on Linux system extensively 

## FIX EXISTING FEATURES
* Fix the github workflow
* Make the console output better especially at the end where it should instead give the number of failed and successful rather than an array of the state of each, and should print the ones that failed
* Add more URLs built-in
* See what online_url is doing and fix it
* Reimplement the the get code system
* Fix folder path on windows

## NEW FEATURES
### Fail-safes

### AMBITIOUS
* *Replace the subject code system with something else?*
* Add a way to pass a url instead of a subject code so user can pick which one they want
* Add a better way to deal with urls (like adding and removing them)
* Migrate to Cython
